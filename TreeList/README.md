#Implementing List-Binary Tree Data Structure
used a modified binary tree data structure to implement a list:
- A Â C++ module, where n is the current size of the list, that can insert, remove, and print entries in just O (log n) worst-case time.
- Compared to traditional methods of implementing a list (arrays and linked lists), which need O(n) time for some of these operations, this is a major improvement.
- The List now provides a vector-like interface with an iterator.
- The module has undergone extensive testing using a range of test cases and adheres to an object-oriented structure.
